## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Fails

If the test fails:

1. **Verify your API key**:
   - Make sure it starts with `AIzaSy`
   - Check for extra spaces or characters
   - Try generating a new key if the old one doesn't work

2. **Check API access**:
   - Ensure the Gemini API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/generativelanguage.googleapis.com

3. **Review quota limits**:
   - Check if you've exceeded free tier limits
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/quotas

### Error: "API key not valid"

- Regenerate your API key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Make sure you're copying the complete key
- Verify the API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console

### Error: "Quota exceeded"

- You've hit the free tier limit
- Wait for the quota to reset (usually per minute or per day)
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan if needed

## Upgrading to Paid Tier

If you need higher limits:

1. Visit Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Billing** â†’ **Link a billing account**
4. Add payment information

**Note**: You'll still benefit from free tier quotas even with billing enabled - you only pay for usage beyond free limits.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to Git**:
   - The app stores keys in browser localStorage only
   - Don't hardcode keys in source code

2. **Use environment-specific keys**:
   - Use different keys for development and production
   - Rotate keys periodically

3. **Monitor usage**:
   - Check your usage at: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/metrics
   - Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges

4. **Restrict API key** (optional, for production):
   - Go to API key settings in Google Cloud Console
   - Add application restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses)
   - Add API restrictions (limit to Gemini API only)
